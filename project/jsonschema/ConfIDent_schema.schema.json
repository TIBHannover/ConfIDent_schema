In contrast to other forms of events, academic events should primarily serve the exchange of results and methods of scientific research and their didactic mediation.  Furthermore, a significant participation of scientific organizations in the realization of an academic event is constitutive for this type of event; for example, to distinguish it from events in which researchers mainly act as external experts or with a purely legitimising function.",

// An academic event is part of the established instruments of science communication as a format for conveying the latest scientific publications. It is defined by the meeting of researchers at a specific time and place (virtual or physical) and with a specific thematic focus to present, hear and discuss these publications. In contrast to other forms of events, academic events should primarily serve the exchange of results and methods of scientific research and their didactic mediation.  Furthermore, a significant participation of scientific organizations in the realization of an academic event is constitutive for this type of event; for example, to distinguish it from events in which researchers mainly act as external experts or with a purely legitimising function.

// An academic event format specification is a plan specification that classifies a planned gathering of people in an academic context according to some sociocultural format, which provides implicit and explicit details on how this gathering is to be carried out by its participants in terms of achieving certain objectives, fulfilling certain conditions and performing certain actions. It thus concretizes the expectations of the contributors of an academic event. While the explicit details are often provided as concrete parts (e.g. deadline or attendance fee specifications), the implicit details depend on the semantics encoded in the words used for the classification of academic events (e.g. "conference" or "workshop"). Depending on the sociocultural background these classifications can overlap or vary to a certain degree.

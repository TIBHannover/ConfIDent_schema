It thus concretizes the expectations of the contributors of an academic event. While the explicit details are often provided as concrete parts (e.g. deadline or attendance fee specifications), the implicit details depend on the semantics encoded in the words used for the classification of academic events (e.g. \"conference\" or \"workshop\").

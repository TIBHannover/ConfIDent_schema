URI: https://tibhannover.github.io/ConfIDent_schema/ Classes Class Description SchemaBasedThing A mixin used in classes that contain schema based values, such as the classifications used to denote the academic field of an event or the external identifiers used to denote a thing. NamedThing A mixin used to provide the attributes needed for the identification of a thing. AcademicEventSeries An academic event series describes the set of academic events which take place on a regular basis and thus have an established common identity. This identity is constituted, for example, through institutional continuity in the hosting of a series (e.g. by a specialised society), thematic focuses and/or a common label under which a series is defined (particularly name and acronym). Nevertheless, it is possible that each of these criteria may change over time. AcademicEvent An academic event is part of the established instruments of science communication as a format for conveying the latest scientific publications. It is defined by the meeting of researchers at a specific time and place (virtual or physical) and with a specific thematic focus to present, hear and discuss these publications. In contrast to other forms of events, academic events should primarily serve the exchange of results and methods of scientific research and their didactic mediation. Furthermore, a significant participation of scientific organizations in the realization of an academic event is constitutive for this type of event; for example, to distinguish it from events in which researchers mainly act as external experts or with a purely legitimising function. ProcessName A container for the various names denoting an academic event or series. ExternalIdentifier An identifer of an entity declared in another schema. DigitalObjectId A centrally registered identifier symbol used to uniquely identify digital objects given by International DOI Foundation. WikidataId The identifier of a thing (item) in Wikidata. GndId The identifier of a thing (item) in the German National authority file. TibkatId The identifier of a publication in the TIB catalog. DblpId The identifier of an academic event or series in dblp. WikiCfpId The identifier of an academic event or series in WikiCFP. EventFormatSpecification An academic event format specification is a plan specification that classifies a planned gathering of people in an academic context according to some sociocultural format, which provides implicit and explicit details on how this gathing is to be carried out by its participants in terms of achieving certain objectives, fulfiling certain conditions and performing certain actions. It thus concretizes the expectations of the contributors of an academic event. While the explicit details are often provied as concrete parts (e.g. deadline or attendance fee specifications), the implicit details depend on the semantics encoded in the words used for the classification of academic events (e.g. \"conference\" or \"workshop\"). Depending on the sociocultural background these classifications can overlap or vary to a certain degree. Deadline A container for event deadlines. Metric A container for statistical information about a planned process. ProcessRelation A container for relations between academic events. Location A container for the information about the location in which an academic event takes place. City The city in which an academic event takes place.

Venue The venue at which an academic event takes place. AcademicField An academic field is the scientific subject of a planned process according to some controlled vocabulary or thesaurus and as such requires the scheme URI. Context A container to provide extra information, such as call of papers event description.

Colloquia are usually part of the academic exchange in everyday university life with only one speaker, but can also take place on special occasions (anniversaries, start or end of the lecture phase, etc.) and can have more than one speaker. conference aeon:0000103 A conference is an academic event that lasts up to several days and serves as a forum for presentations on a specific topic or subject area. In addition to subject-specific conferences, there are also interdisciplinary conferences which allow both a broader focus and more specific questions on a particular (academic) problem. Conferences often have a highly formalized structure of parallel, clearly defined sessions with several short presentations and plenary sessions with invited (keynote) speakers who are considered multipliers in their (research) field. Ideally, the selection of the speakers and their contributions is subject to a review process. congress aeon:0000123 A congress is a certain type of conference which is characterised by a larger number of participants (often several hundred) and is oftentimes organised jointly by large, established (e.g. specialised societies) and/or several institutions. Congresses have a broader thematic focus than simple conferences, take place in certain cycles, but can still target an exclusive group of participants (e.g. representatives of a single discipline). session aeon:0000111 A session is a clearly defined part of a academic event in which a small number of speakers (usually 2-5) focus on a specific topic. A session is usually formally accompanied by a session chair, who assumes the function of a moderator. poster session aeon:0000127 A poster session is a session at which poster papers are presented. talk aeon:0000125 A talk is a central part of a larger academic event, at which a specific topic is being presented in a rather short way. keynote speech aeon:00001115 A keynote speech is a special talk that has the function to set the underlying tone and summarize the core message or most important revelation of the academic event at which it is given. event track aeon:00001117 An academic event that, as a part of a larger academic event, has the function to group even smaller parts of the academic event, like sessions and talks, according to a shared theme or topic. It usually has dedicated chairs and program committees. forum aeon:0000105 An academic event whose sociocultural format is determined in an academic event type specification that classifies the academic event as a forum. hackathon aeon:0000107 A hackathon is a gathering of software developers with the goal to develop software collaboratively in a short timeframe. seminar aeon:0000109 A seminar can serve as a term for older conference series, but in current usage the term mainly describes a specific teaching format that serves to develop content and provides space for discussion. Participation from the audience is usually encouraged. symposium aeon:0000113 A symposium is a specific type of conference with a narrower thematic focus, with fewer participants and of shorter duration. The degree of structuring lies between a classic conference and a workshop, allows more discussion than the larger conference, but is usually more formalized than the workshop. tutorial aeon:0000119 An academic event that has the function to educate the audience on a certain topic. A tutorial is often realized as an academic event talk or academic event session. workshop aeon:0000121 Workshops are smaller academic events that serve to exchange information on a specific topic or problem.

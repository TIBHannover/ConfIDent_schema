<td align="left">colloquium</td>
<td align="center">A colloquium is an academic meeting that usually lasts only a few hours and serves to discuss a specific topic. Colloquia are usually part of the academic exchange in everyday university life with only one speaker, but can also take place on special occasions (anniversaries, start or end of the lecture phase, etc.) and can have more than one speaker.</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">conference</td>
<td align="center">A conference is an academic event that lasts up to several days and serves as a forum for presentations on a specific topic or subject area. In addition to subject-specific conferences, there are also interdisciplinary conferences which allow both a broader focus and more specific questions on a particular (academic) problem. Conferences often have a highly formalized structure of parallel, clearly defined sessions with several short presentations and plenary sessions with invited (keynote) speakers who are considered multipliers in their (research) field. Ideally, the selection of the speakers and their contributions is subject to a review process.</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">congress</td>
<td align="center">A congress is a certain type of conference which is characterised by a larger number of participants (often several hundred) and is oftentimes organised jointly by large, established (e.g. specialised societies) and/or several institutions. Congresses have a broader thematic focus than simple conferences, take place in certain cycles, but can still target an exclusive group of participants (e.g. representatives of a single discipline).</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">session</td>
<td align="center">A session is a clearly defined part of a academic event in which a small number of speakers (usually 2-5) focus on a specific topic. A session is usually formally accompanied by a session chair, who assumes the function of a moderator.</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">event track</td>
<td align="center">An academic event that, as a part of a larger academic event, has the function to group even smaller parts of the academic event, like sessions and talks, according to a shared theme or topic. It usually has dedicated chairs and program committees.</td>

<td align="left">symposium</td>
<td align="center">A symposium is a specific type of conference with a narrower thematic focus, with fewer participants and of shorter duration.

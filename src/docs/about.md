# About ConfIDent Metadata Schema

This is a schema for the [ConfIDent project](https://www.confident-conference.org). It describes the necessary metadata requirements of academic events and event series.

It is currently still under development and being synced with the requirements of the production system (a Semantic Media Wiki).

ConfIDent makes descriptive metadata on conferences and other formats of scientific events permanently accessible in a high quality through automated processes and scientific data curation.
